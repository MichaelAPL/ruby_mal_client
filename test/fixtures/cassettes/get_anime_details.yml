        the year 2071, humanity has colonized several of the planets and moons of
        the solar system leaving the now uninhabitable surface of planet Earth behind.

        in part by outlaw bounty hunters, referred to as \"Cowboys.\" The ragtag team
        aboard the spaceship Bebop are two such individuals.\n \nMellow and carefree
        Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic partner Jet Black as
        the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting rewards. Thrown off

        each member''s dark and mysterious past little by little.\n\nWell-balanced
        with high density action and light-hearted comedy, Cowboy Bebop is a space

        after.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","mean":8.77,"rank":34,"popularity":43,"num_list_users":1516995,"num_scoring_users":737728,"nsfw":"white","created_at":"2005-06-30T05:01:56+00:00","updated_at":"2021-12-31T02:07:33+00:00","media_type":"tv","status":"finished_airing","genres":[{"id":1,"name":"Action"},{"id":2,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":4,"name":"Comedy"},{"id":8,"name":"Drama"},{"id":24,"name":"Sci-Fi"},{"id":29,"name":"Space"}],"num_episodes":26,"start_season":{"year":1998,"season":"spring"},"broadcast":{"day_of_the_week":"saturday","start_time":"01:00"},"source":"original","average_episode_duration":1440,"rating":"r","pictures":[{"medium":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/3791.jpg","large":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/3791l.jpg"},{"medium":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/19609.jpg","large":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/19609l.jpg"},{"medium":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/19644.jpg","large":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/19644l.jpg"},{"medium":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/22882.jpg","large":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/4\/22882l.jpg"},{"medium":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/22883.jpg","large":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/22883l.jpg"},{"medium":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/22885.jpg","large":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/22885l.jpg"},{"medium":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/53939.jpg","large":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/53939l.jpg"},{"medium":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/2\/78836.jpg","large":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/2\/78836l.jpg"},{"medium":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/81920.jpg","large":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/12\/81920l.jpg"},{"medium":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1635\/90587.jpg","large":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1635\/90587l.jpg"},{"medium":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1553\/91487.jpg","large":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1553\/91487l.jpg"},{"medium":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1519\/91488.jpg","large":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1519\/91488l.jpg"},{"medium":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1764\/109632.jpg","large":"https:\/\/api-cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1764\/109632l.jpg"}],"background":"When
        Cowboy Bebop first aired in spring of 1998 on TV Tokyo, only episodes 2, 3,
        7-15, and 18 were broadcast, it was concluded with a recap special known as
        Yose Atsume Blues. This was due to anime censorship having increased following
        the big controversies over Evangelion, as a result most of the series was
        pulled from the air due to violent content. Satellite channel WOWOW picked
        up the series in the fall of that year and aired it in its entirety uncensored.
        Cowboy Bebop was not a ratings hit in Japan, but sold over 19,000 DVD units
        in the initial release run, and 81,000 overall. Protagonist Spike Spiegel
        won Best Male Character, and Megumi Hayashibara won Best Voice Actor for her
        role as Faye Valentine in the 1999 and 2000 Anime Grand Prix, respectively.\n\nCowboy
        Bebop''s biggest influence has been in the United States, where it premiered
        on Adult Swim in 2001 with many reruns since. The show''s heavy Western influence
        struck a chord with American viewers, where it became a \"gateway drug\" to
        anime aimed at adult audiences.","related_anime":[{"node":{"id":5,"title":"Cowboy
